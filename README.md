## About
倚栏听风 IDE是一个全新的结合实时运行评测与代码共享的平台

在原作的基础上，不仅让代码的运行更加自然，还添加了包括对比输入输出结果（Diff Editor）在内的多种功能

进一步地提供了代码快照共享的功能，希望能够给需要分享代码运行返回实况，包括测试用例，编译运行结果等在内的多样化功能等待用户去探索

后端采用Django编写，高安全性

Below is the original ABOUT

[**Judge0 IDE**](https://ide.judge0.com) is a free and open-source online code editor that allows you to write and execute code from a rich set of languages. It's perfect for anybody who just wants to quickly write and run some code without opening a full-featured IDE on their computer. Moreover, it is also useful for teaching and learning or just trying out a new language.

Judge0 IDE is using [**Judge0**](https://api.judge0.com) for executing user's source code.
